Cygwin Ver. 2.905, OS: Win10, 64-bit

(Some option may cause core dumped, but there's no problem executed by visual studio)


Compilation Guide
------------------

(1) Contains "Makefile" for combination.
	"QM.h" for algorithms in Quine-McCluskey method.
	"QM.cpp" for main function. 
	
(2) Enter "make" to create an execution file named "E14061313_Logic_System_QM.exe"
   
(3) Also create object files "QM.o".
   
(4) Key in "./E14061313_Logic_System_QM.exe" to implement the Quine-McCluskey process.
   
(5) Choose the option to input the file.
   
(6) Key in "5" for executing specific input files.
	=> ex. Key in "filein.txt"
      
(7) Key in "1", "2", "3" ,"4" for executing data in the file "Execution_file".
