# Quine-McCluskey Method 2 - 10 variables

Description
--------------------
1. Write a program to implement a 8~10-variable by Quine-McCluskey method. 
2. Show the "prime implicant chart" and the "final result in minimum SOP".  


Five given input files of the E14061313_2: 

(1) 10_Variable_Test.txt

(2) 9_Variable_Test.txt

(3) 8_Variable_Test.txt

(4) 4_Variable_Test.txt

(5) filein.txt


Bonus
--------------------
(1) My code can execute 2 - 10 variables

(2) Adorable Interface :)


Platform information
--------------------
Visual Studio 2013

&

Cygwin Ver. 2.905, OS: Win10, 64-bit

(Some option may cause core dumped, but there's no problem executed by visual studio)


Compilation Guide
------------------
1. File name "Execution_File" 

   A. Contains "E14061313_Logic_System_QM.exe" for exeution.
   
   B. Contains "4_Variable_Test.txt", "8_Variable_Test.txt", "9_Variable_Test.txt", 
      "10_Variable_Test.txt", "filein.txt" for inputdata.
      
   C. Key in "./E14061313_Logic_System_QM.exe" to implement the Quine-McCluskey process.
   
   D. Choose the option to input the file.
   
   E. Key in "5" for executing specific input files.
      => ex. Key in "filein.txt"
      
   F. Key in "1", "2", "3" ,"4" for executing data in the file "Execution_file". 

2. File name "Source_Code" 

   A. Contains "Makefile" for combination.
	"QM.h" for algorithms in Quine-McCluskey method.
	"QM.cpp" for main function. 
	
   B. Enter "make" to create an execution file named "E14061313_Logic_System_QM.exe"
   
   C. Also create object files "QM.o".
   
   D. Key in "./E14061313_Logic_System_QM.exe" to implement the Quine-McCluskey process.
   
   E. Choose the option to input the file.
   
   F. Key in "5" for executing specific input files.
      => ex. Key in "filein.txt"
